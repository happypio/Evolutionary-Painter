# Evolutionary painter

This is an evolutionary painter, which paints given image with triangles.
The algorithm is in file [triangles_reconstruction](https://github.com/happypio/Evolutionary-Painter/blob/master/triangles_reconstruction.ipynb). All you need is to read image and run it on default parameters!

In [raport](https://github.com/happypio/Evolutionary-Painter/blob/master/triangles_raport.pdf) you can read more precisely about my project. 

Here are some results!
